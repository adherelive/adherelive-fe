# Migration Plan: Node 18+ Upgrade

## Phase 1: Environment and Dependency Analysis (2-3 days)

### 1.1 Setup Testing Environment
- Create a new git branch for Node 18 migration
- Set up parallel CI/CD pipeline for testing Node 18 builds
- Create a staging environment running Node 18

### 1.2 Dependency Audit
Critical packages requiring updates:
- `react-mde` (blocking React 17+ upgrade)
- `react` and `react-dom` (currently at 16.x)
- `@ant-design/compatible` (needs version alignment)
- `react-timekeeper` (may need replacement)
- `react-places-autocomplete` (maintenance status check)

## Phase 2: React Ecosystem Upgrade (1-2 weeks)

### 2.1 React 16 to 17 Migration
1. Replace `react-mde` with modern alternatives:
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "@uiw/react-md-editor": "^3.6.0"     }
   }
   ```
   
    Or use the below compatible package
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "react-simplemde-editor": "^5.2.0"
     }
   }
   ```


2. Update core React packages:
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "react": "^17.0.2",
       "react-dom": "^17.0.2"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Run codemod scripts for React 17 compatibility:
   ```bash
   npx react-codemod update-react-imports
   ```

### 2.2 React 17 to 18 Migration
1. Update React packages:
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "react": "^18.2.0",
       "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Update React ecosystem packages:
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "react-redux": "^9.0.0",
       "react-router-dom": "^6.21.0",
       "@redux/toolkit": "^2.0.0"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Handle React 18 specific changes:
    - Replace `ReactDOM.render` with `ReactDOM.createRoot`
    - Update event pooling code
    - Review automatic batching implications

## Phase 3: UI Library Updates (1 week)

### 3.1 Material UI
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@mui/material": "^5.15.0",
    "@mui/icons-material": "^5.15.0",
    "@mui/lab": "^5.0.0-alpha.155",
    "@emotion/react": "^11.11.0",

{
  "dependencies": {
    "antd": "^5.12.0",
    "@ant-design/icons": "^5.2.0",
    "@ant-design/compatible": "^5.1.0"
  }
}
```

## Phase 4: Third-party Package Updates (1 week)

### 4.1 Development Tools
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@craco/craco": "^7.1.0",
    "react-scripts": "^5.0.1",
    "web-vitals": "^3.5.0"
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Feature-specific Packages
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "agora-rtc-sdk-ng": "^4.19.0",
    "firebase": "^10.7.0",
    "chart.js": "^4.4.0",
    "react-chartjs-2": "^5.2.0"
  }
}
```

## Phase 5: Node 18 Specific Updates (2-3 days)

### 5.1 Update package.json
```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0",
    "npm": ">=9.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Update Build Scripts
- Review and update npm scripts
- Update CI/CD configurations
- Update Docker configurations if applicable

## Phase 6: Testing and Validation (1-2 weeks)

### 6.1 Test Strategy
1. Unit Tests
    - Update test runners
    - Update testing libraries
    - Run full test suite

2. Integration Tests
    - Test all API integrations
    - Verify WebSocket connections
    - Check file upload/download features

3. End-to-End Tests
    - Cross-browser testing
    - Mobile responsiveness
    - Performance benchmarking

### 6.2 Performance Monitoring
- Set up metrics for:
    - Build times
    - Runtime performance
    - Memory usage
    - Load times

## Phase 7: Deployment (2-3 days)

### 7.1 Deployment Strategy
1. Update deployment scripts
2. Configure Node 18 in production environment
3. Plan rollback strategy
4. Update monitoring and logging

### 7.2 Rollout Plan
1. Deploy to development environment
2. Test in staging environment
3. Gradual rollout to production
4. Monitor for issues

## Timeline and Resources

### Estimated Timeline
- Total duration: 4-6 weeks
- Critical path: React ecosystem updates
- Parallel tracks: UI library updates and third-party package updates

### Required Resources
- Frontend developers
- QA engineers
- DevOps support
- Product owner for feature validation

### Risk Mitigation
1. Maintain comprehensive test coverage
2. Keep detailed documentation of changes
3. Prepare rollback procedures
4. Set up feature flags for gradual rollout

## Success Criteria
